  <h1>About Me:</h1>
Hello! My name is Gautam, and I’m a 13-year-old from India. I have a passion for creating webpages, where I can express my creativity and learn new skills.<br><br>

<h1>Interests:</h1>
When I'm not creating webpages online, you can find me skateboarding through the neighborhood or playing football with my friends. I love the thrill of sports and the joy of spending time outdoors. Nature is my happy place, and I enjoy hiking to explore new trails and appreciate the beauty around me.<br>

I also have a musical side! I play the drums and love making music that brings people together. <br><br>

<h1>Fun Facts:</h1> 
I like to think of myself as quite funny and smart, always ready to share a laugh or a clever idea.
School is an exciting adventure for me, where I get to learn new things every day. <br><br>

<h1>Quote:</h1>
"Life is like a skateboard: sometimes you fall, but it’s all about getting back up and rolling again."

I’m always eager to learn more, make new friends, and have fun adventures along the way!
